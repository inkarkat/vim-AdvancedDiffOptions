DESCRIPTION				     *AdvancedDiffOptions-description*

Vim provides a nice |diff-mode|; parameters like case- or whitespace-
insensitivity can be controlled through the 'diffopt' option. However, because
that option controls both the difference filtering itself as well as the
visual appearance within Vim, modifying that option on the fly with `:set`
isn't very comfortable.

This plugin provides a set of :DiffI... commands that enable you to quickly
toggle the built-in diff filtering options, and adds advanced options for
filtering blank lines, complete change hunks, lines, ranges, or patterns of
text.

HOW IT WORKS								     *

When there's a corresponding command-line option for the "diff" tool, this is
passed. The filtering of lines, ranges, and patterns is implemented by
preprocessing the buffers through the external "sed" command.

==============================================================================
USAGE						   *AdvancedDiffOptions-usage*
								*:DiffOptions*
:DiffOptions		List the currently active diff options.
								 *:DiffIClear*
:DiffIClear		Clear all "ignore ..." diff options.
							    *:DiffIWhiteSpace*
:DiffIWhiteSpace[!]	Ignore changes in whitespace. [!] for undo.
								  *:DiffICase*
:DiffICase[!]		Ignore changes in case. [!] for undo.
							    *:DiffIBlankLines*
:DiffIBlankLines[!]	Ignore blank lines. [!] for undo.
								 *:DiffIHunks*
:DiffIHunks[!] [{expr}]	Ignore change hunks whose lines _all_ match {expr}.
			[!] for undo.
								 *:DiffILines*
:DiffILines[!] [{expr}]	Do not consider any lines that match "sed-style"
			{expr} in the diff. [!] for undo.
								 *:DiffIRange*
:DiffIRange[!] [{range}]
			Do not consider any lines that match the "sed-style"
			range specified by {range} in the diff. [!] for undo.
			Note that Vim will still highlight additional lines at
			the end of the longer buffer.
							       *:DiffIPattern*
:DiffIPattern[!] [{expr}]
			Do not consider any text that matches {expr}
			"sed-style" in the diff (globally, not just the first
			match).
			[!] for undo, i.e. removing {expr}, or all previously
			given patterns.
			Note that Vim will still highlight the ignored changes
			(should there be another change in the line that is
			not covered by {expr}), because it determines that on
			its own.

EXAMPLE						 *AdvancedDiffOptions-example*

Filter all diff hunks that only consist of comments in a Perl script: >
    :DiffIHunks ^#
<
Ignore any differences after a line matching "EOF": >
    :DiffIRange /^EOF$/,$
<
Ignore type differences of "char const" vs. "char" in a C program: >
    :DiffIPattern [ ]const
<
==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				    *AdvancedDiffOptions-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim AdvancedDiffOptions*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				    *AdvancedDiffOptions-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.012 or
  higher.
- External command "diff" or equivalent for listing of differences.
- External command "sed" for some advanced filters.
